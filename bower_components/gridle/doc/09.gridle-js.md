```

These are the options available

	// make gridle output some console.log
	debug : true,
	
	// callback when the states changes
	onUpdate : function(updatedStates, activeStates, inactiveStates) {
		// do something here...
	},

	// optional : if specified, will fetch only this css file, otherwise, will fetch all the css in document until find states
	cssPath : 'css/grid.css'  	// default : null

});
```

```javascript
Gridle.on('update', function(updatedStates, activeStates, inactiveStates) {
	// do something here
});
```

#### isReady

```javascript
if ( Gridle.isReady() ) {
	// do something here...
}
```

#### isActive

This method allows you to check if a state is active

```javascript
if ( Gridle.isActive('mobile') ) {
	console.log('mobile state is active');
}
```

#### getRegistredStates

This method allows you to get all the registered states

```javascript
var states = Gridle.getRegisteredStates();
```

#### getUpdatedStates

This method allows you to get all updated states. Be careful, this will be available only when the states change, then, when the screen is resized and the states are the same, this will be empty...

```javascript
var states = Gridle.getUpdatedStates();
```

#### getUpdatedStatesNames

```javascript
var states = Gridle.getUpdatedStatesNames();
```

#### getActiveStates

Allows you to get the active states

```javascript
var states = Gridle.getActiveStates();
```

#### getActiveStatesNames

Same as getActiveStates, but return an array of names only

```javascript
var states = Gridle.getActiveStatesNames();
```

#### getInactiveStates

Allows you to get the unactive states

```javascript
var states = Gridle.getInactiveStates();
```

#### getInactiveStatesNames

Same as getUnactiveStates, but return an array of names only

```javascript
var states = Gridle.getInactiveStatesNames();
```


### Events

Gridle js trigger some events to be notified of states change, etc... Here's a list

```fn
ready
```

This event notify that gridle has find the states in css and is ready to check changes

```fn
update
```

This event is the main one. It notifies you that some states have changed.


### Subscribe to an event

The events in gridle.js are emitted through multiple channel. jQuery events are supported and you can also use the simple built-in event function to subscribe to an event. Here's how :

#### Built-in

```javascript
Gridle.on('update', function(updatedStates, activeStates, inactiveStates) {
	// do something here...	
});
```

#### jQuery

By using jQuery, you can either subscribe directly on the Gridle object, or through the "body" DOM node

```javascript
// directly on Gridle :
jQuery(Gridle).bind('update', function(updatedStates, activeStates, inactiveStates) {
	// do something here...	
});

// through the body node :
jQuery('body').trigger('gridle.update', function(updatedStates, activeStates, inactiveStates) {
	// do something here...	
});
```

> Be careful, when listen for event through the body tag, the event name will be prefixed by "gridle.". For example, update will become "gridle.update"
