Internet Explorer
--------------------

Internet Explorer... Holy crap! Troubles ahead you say? Don't worry â€“ Gridle is fully compatible with it... as long as you go the extra length with this the old chap.


### IE7 support

This option control the generation of expression in css to allow IE7 to render width correctly. If you don't need IE7 support, you can desactivate this option. This will generate a little bit less css for your grid.

```scss
@include gridle_setup( (
	context : 12,
	// etc...
	ie7-support : : true; // by default is false
) );	
```


### RespondJS

In order to make the media queries works on IE7-8, you have to integrate <a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond" title="Respond JS" target="_blank">RespondJS</a>, witch is a nice little plug&play library written by Scott Jehl

```markup
<link href="css/style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
...
<!--[if (gte IE 6)&(lte IE 9)]>
<script src="js/vendor/respond.js"></script>
<![endif]-->
```
