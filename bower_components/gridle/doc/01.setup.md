Setup
------------------

In order for Gridle to work, the `gridle_setup()` mixin **needs to be run**. This is where you can pass core configuration variables like the amount of columns (context) and the width of the gutter.


```fn
@include gridle_setup( {settings} );
```

```scss
$settings : (
	context : 12, 			// number of columns in your grid
	gutter-width : 20px,		// size of the gutters
	direction : ltr, 			// direction
	name-multiplicator : 1 	// to generate like grid-5, grid-10, etc...
	// and more... (see in advanced settings section)
);
@include gridle_setup($settings);
```

> Make sure that your states do not have the same name as a gridle option like gutter-width...
